# Billing FAQ

This topic provides answers to some commonly asked questions about the billing methods of Dedicated Host \(DDH\).

## Which billing methods does DDH support?

DDH supports the [Subscription](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Subscription.md) billing method. When you purchase a dedicated host, you are charged for the duration of use, regardless of the resource usage on the dedicated host. For more information, see [Billing overview](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Billing overview.md).

## Do I need to pay for the ECS instances that run on a dedicated host?

When you create Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instances on a dedicated host, you are not charged for the vCPU and memory of the instance. However, you are charged for the disks, internet bandwidth, images, and snapshots of the instance. For more information about the billing methods of ECS instances, see [Billing overview](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Billing overview.md).

## What do I do when my dedicated host expires or my Alibaba Cloud account has an insufficient balance?

If you want to use an expired dedicated host, you must renew it. Otherwise, the dedicated host and the ECS instances on it will be automatically stopped. For more information, see [Subscription](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Subscription.md).

If the account is suspended, you must [submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ticket/createIndex) to add funds to your account.
