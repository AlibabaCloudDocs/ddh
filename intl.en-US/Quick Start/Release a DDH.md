# Release a DDH {#task_lmg_wmn_tdb .task}

If you do not need a DDH anymore, you can release it.

Before releasing a DDH, make sure the following:

-   Its billing method is Pay-As-You-Go. You cannot manually release a Subscription DDH.
-   No ECS instances are hosted on the DDH.

[Pay-As-You-Go](../../../../intl.en-US/Pricing/Pay-As-You-Go.md#)You are billed for holding a DDH even if you do not use its resources. If you do not need a Pay-As-You-Go DDH any more, we recommend that you release it to avoid any unnecessary fees.

You can release a Pay-As-You-Go DDH in the ECS console. This document describes how to manually release a Pay-As-You-Go DDH in the ECS console. For more information about auto release, see [Enable or disable auto release](../../../../intl.en-US/User Guide/Enable or disable auto release.md#).

1.   Log on to the [ECS console](https://ecs.console.aliyun.com/#/home). 
2.   In the left-side navigation pane, click **Dedicated Hosts**. 
3.   Select a region. 
4.   Select one or more DDHs, and on the top of the table, select **Actions** \> **Release** . 
5.   In the dialog box, select **Release Now**, and then click **OK**.
