# What is DDH?

Dedicated Host \(DDH\) is a specialized solution that Alibaba Cloud provides for enterprise customers. It provides dedicated physical resources, flexible deployment, rich configurations, and high cost-efficiency. DDH can reduce the total cost of ownership \(TCO\) when enterprises migrate business to the cloud.

A dedicated host is a cloud host whose physical resources are dedicated to a single tenant. As the only tenant of a host, you do not need to share its physical resources with other tenants. You can obtain the physical attributes of the host, including the number of CPUs \(number of sockets\), number of physical CPU cores, and memory size. You can also create Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instances of an instance family that is compatible with the host type. For more information about dedicated host types, see [Dedicated host types](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Dedicated host types.md).

## Features

DDH supports automatic deployment and host association. You can use DDH to flexibly deploy your business. For more information, see [Features](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Features.md).

## Scenarios

DDH meets strict security and compliance requirements and allows you to bring your own licenses \(BYOLs\) to the cloud. DDH can significantly reduce the cost of migrating your business to the cloud. For more information, see [Scenarios](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Scenarios.md).
