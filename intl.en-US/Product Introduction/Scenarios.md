# Scenarios

Dedicated Host \(DDH\) allows you to flexibly deploy your workloads, ensures security and compliance, and reduces the cost of migration to the cloud. This topic describes the application scenarios of DDH.

## Reduce the deployment cost of a single ECS instance

DDH can be used for applications with low CPU usage, and cloud migration involving virtual environments such as OpenStack and KVM from physical servers. Dedicated hosts of the CPU Overprovisioned type can effectively reduce the cost for the deployment of a single instance in these scenarios. For more information about the CPU Overprovisioned type, see [Dedicated host types](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Dedicated host types.md).

## Bring your own license \(BYOL\)

You can continue to use your own licenses on dedicated hosts if the licenses are assigned based on the numbers of CPU cores, CPU sockets, and virtual machines subject to the terms of the license. DDH can lower the cost of migrating your workloads to the cloud. These licenses include but are not limited to Microsoft Windows Server and Microsoft SQL Server.

## Ensure strict security and compliance requirements

The resources of a dedicated host are isolated from other servers so that you can use DDH to meet the strict requirements of physical isolation. You can create ECS instances on a specified physical server so that you can meet the strict compliance requirements of the runtime environment for your workloads.

## Maintain stable performance

Some specialized industries, such as the gaming industry, require high computing capability and stability. DDH improves the stability of CPU and network I/O to ensure a smooth gaming experience.

## Automatic deployment

You can manually specify a dedicated host or select automatic deployment when you create an ECS instance. If automatic deployment is selected, the system automatically selects a dedicated host to run the instances. You can also migrate instances from a shared host to a dedicated host, or migrate instances between dedicated hosts. Flexible deployment and migration help you orchestrate your applications.
