# What is a Dedicated Host {#concept_yqx_czm_tdb .concept}

You can learn the basic concepts of a dedicated host and the difference between a dedicated host and a shared cloud hosting server.

An Alibaba Cloud Dedicated Host, abbreviated to DDH, is a dedicated cloud host that allows you to exercise full control over the physical server. but not to share with other tenants. All the physical server attributes are visible to you, including the number of sockets, physical CPU cores, and the memory size. The Dedicated Host types determine ECS instance type families that are eligible to be created on the DDHs based on [dedicated host types](intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Dedicated Host types.md#).

The difference between a DDH and a shared cloud hosting server is illustrated as follows.

## Basic concept {#section_qrr_mzm_tdb .section}

For the DDH related basic concept, see [glossary](intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Glossary.md#).

## Billing and pricing {#section_rrr_mzm_tdb .section}

Subscription is supported for billing. For more information, see [pricing overview](../../../../intl.en-US/Pricing/Pricing overview.md#).

## Related services {#section_srr_mzm_tdb .section}

The ECS instances created on a DDH support the same Alibaba Cloud services as those on shared cloud hosting servers. For more information, see [what is ECS](../../../../intl.en-US/Product Introduction/What is ECS?.md#).

For the functional differences between the ECS instance on a DDH and that on a shared cloud hosting server, see [comparing ECS features on different hosts](intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Comparing ECS features on different hosts.md#).

## Operations {#section_trr_mzm_tdb .section}

To manage a DDH, see [limits](intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Limits.md#).

You can use the [ECS console](https://ecs.console.aliyun.com/#/home) to manage a DDH:

-   [Create a DDH](../../../../intl.en-US/Quick Start/Create a DDH.md#).
-   [Create an ECS instance on a DDH](../../../../intl.en-US/Quick Start/Create an ECS instance on a DDH.md#).
-   [Migrate ECS across DDHs](../../../../intl.en-US/User Guide/Migrate ECS across DDHs.md#).
-   [Migrate ECS from a shared cloud hosting server to a DDH](../../../../intl.en-US/User Guide/Migrate ECS from a shared cloud hosting server to a DDH.md#).
-   On a Subscription DDH, you can convert the billing method of Pay-As-You-Go to Subscription. For more information, see [Switch from Pay-As-You-Go to Subscription billing](../../../../intl.en-US/Pricing/Limits.md#).
-   For a Subscription DDH, you can [auto renewal](../../../../intl.en-US/User Guide/Auto renewal.md#) or [manual renewal](../../../../intl.en-US/User Guide/Manual renewal.md#).
