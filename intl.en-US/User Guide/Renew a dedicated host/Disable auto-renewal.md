# Disable auto-renewal

You can disable the auto-renewal feature if necessary. This topic describes how to disable the auto-renewal of a subscription dedicated host.

A subscription dedicated host must meet the following requirements:

-   You have enabled the auto-renewal feature.
-   The dedicated host cannot be **Expired**. For more information about the status of a dedicated host, see [Lifecycle of dedicated hosts](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Lifecycle of dedicated hosts.md).

If the auto-renewal feature is disabled, the resource status changes after the dedicated host expires. For more information, see [t6626.md\#section\_dvy\_m25\_tdb](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Subscription.md).

1.  Log on to the [ECS console](https://ecs.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Instances & Images** \> **Dedicated Hosts**.

3.  In the top navigation bar, select a region.

4.  Select the target dedicated host. Choose **Actions** \> **Change Renew Settings**.

5.  In Change Renew Settings dialog box, turn off the **Enable Auto Renew** switch. You can decide whether to enable **Do Not Renew upon Expiration**. If you enable it, then the dedicated host is not renewed when it expires.
