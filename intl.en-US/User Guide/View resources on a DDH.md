You can manage the resources on a Dedicated Host \(DDH\) in the ECS console.

For more information about the available resources of a DDH, see [Create a DDH](../../../../intl.en-US/Quick Start/Create a DDH.md#).

1.   Log on to the [ECS console](https://ecs.console.aliyun.com/#/home). 
2.   In the left-side navigation pane, click **DDH**. 
3.   Select a region. 
4.   In the host list, view **vCPU Usage/Total**, **Memory Usage/Total**, and **Local disk Usage/Total**. 

    **Note:** 

    -   For the total resources corresponding to different host types, see [Dedicated Host types](../../../../intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Dedicated Host types.md#).
    -   The **Local Storage Usage/Total** of non-SSD DDH is shown as **0/0**.
5.   Select a DDH and view its details on the **DDH Details** window.![](images/1348_en-US.png)
